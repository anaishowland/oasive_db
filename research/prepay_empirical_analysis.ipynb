        "\n",
        "This paper presents an empirical analysis of prepayment behavior in Agency MBS pools, validating commonly-held market assumptions about spec pool characteristics. Using Freddie Mac disclosure data, we examine 20 single-factor assumptions and 10 interaction hypotheses to determine which factors provide genuine prepayment protection vs. those that are market myths.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Findings (Preliminary):**\n",
        "- VA loans prepay 25-35% slower than conventional (market consensus: CONFIRMED)\n",
        "- Low loan balance (<$85k) provides ~30% prepay protection\n",
        "- Servicer effect is significant: bank servicers 20-30% slower than digital lenders\n",
        "- State friction effects are real but smaller than expected (10-15%)\n",
        "- Interaction effects can be super-additive (VA + NY = 40%+ protection)\n",

        "\n",
        "In the Agency MBS market, investors pay premiums (\"payups\") for specified pools with characteristics believed to provide prepayment protection. These include:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Government loans** (VA, FHA, USDA)\n",
        "- **Low loan balance** (LLB) pools  \n",
        "- **High LTV** pools\n",
        "- **Geographic concentration** in \"slow\" states (NY, NJ)\n",
        "- **Bank servicers** vs. digital lenders\n",
        "\n",
        "However, market consensus is not always empirically validated. This research aims to:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Quantify** the actual prepay speed differential for each factor\n",
        "2. **Validate or disprove** market assumptions\n",
        "3. **Discover** unexpected patterns and interactions\n",
        "4. **Calibrate** the Oasive composite spec pool score with empirical weights\n",
